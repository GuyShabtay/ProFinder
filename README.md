# ProFinder
<p>A website where users can find relevant professionals nearby. Each user can leave
comments and ratings and also create several profession profiles for himself.</p>
<p>After a user registers, his information is saved in the system (in the MongoDB database) where all his profiles, comments and ratings are also saved and I also performed statistics of this data in order to improve the site.</p>
